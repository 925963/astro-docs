---

Issue Quality for Jira is built around two core concepts: **Quality standards** and **Validations**.

## Quality standards

A [Quality standard](/astro-docs/concepts/quality-standard/) is a (set of) criteria for an Issue to be considered of good quality. You define what quality means for your organisation or your project.

Quality standards can be set at the Global level (applying to all projects) or at the Project level (applying only to a specific project).

## Validations

A [Validation](/astro-docs/concepts/validations/) is the event where an Issue is assessed against the Quality standards that are in scope for the Issue. Validations happen automatically whenever an issue is created or updated.
